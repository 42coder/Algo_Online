# Learn To Think Like A Computer Scientist
By: Tim Roughgarden, Stanford University

## Description
Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications 
as well as intellectual depth. This specialization is an introduction to algorithms for learners 
with at least a little programming experience. The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the 
big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details. 
After completing this specialization, you will be well-positioned to ace your technical interviews 
and speak fluently about algorithms with other programmers and computer scientists.

About the instructor: Tim Roughgarden has been a professor in the Computer Science Department at 
Stanford University since 2004. He has taught and published extensively on the subject of algorithms 
and their applications.

## Courses
- Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
- Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
- Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
- Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them

## About the Code
NEED TO SORT OUT A LOT OF THINGS IN THE CODE DUE TO MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF DIFFERENT HEADER FILES

Consist of the code that I tried making for the course

Also has 2 header files for some basic functions and classes used

A GitHub repository of test cases can be found from [here](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs)
#### Legend & Notes:
- dShort - Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm
- minCut - Karger's Min-Cut algorithm
- scc - Kosaraju's 2 Pass algorithm
- kmul - Karatsuba Multiplication

#### Header Files
- struct.h - Stacks, Union-Find
- graphs.h - Graph class using vectors and pair

#### Current Issues:
- minCut - sometimes Segmentation fault and sometimes wrong output
- scc - a really ugly code that gives Segmentation Faults
- kmul - write a c++ program for it
