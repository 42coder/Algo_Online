# Algorithms Specialization 
# Learn To Think Like A Computer Scientist
By: Tim Roughgarden, Stanford University

## Courses
- Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
- Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
- Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
- Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them

## About the Code
Consist of the code that I tried making for the course

Also has 2 header files for some basic functions and classes used

- dShort - Dijkstra Shortest Path algorithm
- minCut - Karger's Min-Cut algorithm
- scc    - for now DFS but needs to be made into Kosaraju's 2 Pass algorithm
